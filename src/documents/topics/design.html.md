What is design?
---------------
At its root, design isn't just making a project look pretty, but also making decisions that will affect how the users use your app. There are three main components of design: User Interface (also called UI), which is about the interactions the user has to go through to do things; User Experience (or UX) is all the feelings a person has when using your app; and asthetic design, which is about picking colors, fonts, and other elements in the layer of "paint" on your app.
